# AI-TRAVEL
An AI-powered travel planning app that generates personalized, real-time itineraries using user preferences, live travel data, and smart recommendations, with integrated booking and offline access.

AI Travel Planner — Project Description

AI Travel Planner is an intelligent, end-to-end travel planning application that automatically creates personalized, optimized, and bookable itineraries based on user preferences, real-time travel data, and AI-driven recommendations.

The platform allows users to define their travel style (budget, interests, pace, dietary and accessibility needs), choose a destination and dates, and instantly receive a day-by-day travel plan including attractions, transportation, dining, and accommodations. The AI continuously adapts the itinerary using live data such as weather conditions, availability, pricing, and disruptions, ensuring travelers always have the most relevant and feasible plans.

The application integrates maps, timelines, and offline access, enabling users to view, edit, and reorder activities seamlessly. Users can book flights, hotels, and experiences directly through trusted partners via secure affiliate links, while receiving real-time notifications for schedule changes or better alternatives.

Built with React Native (Expo) and a scalable microservices backend, the AI Travel Planner combines machine learning, rule-based optimization, and real-time event handling to deliver a smooth and intelligent travel planning experience for both casual travelers and frequent explorers.
